# Scripts

# What is this ?

This git repository as only one goal: it's a backup of every different scripts I have made so far.

Majority of those scripts have been made during my internship in the **VAADER** team of **IETR** for my research on **Tangled Program Graphs** and **Versatile Video Coding**, so they are very specific.

## Usage

The great majority of those scrips have a *usage* section at the beginning specifying how to use them. Whatever, since it's a lot of copy-paste this section may not be up-to-date.

## Python


#### Launch

````bash
python3.6 name_of_the_script.py
````

#### Install package

````bash
python -m pip install name_of_the_package
````


### Virtualenv usage


I recommend to create a virtual environment in order to use these python scripts :
